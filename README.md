# LaunchDarkly sample Android application 

We've built a simple mobile application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.  Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/) or the [Android reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/android).

## Build instructions 

1. Make sure you have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) installed.
2. Edit `MainActivity.java`  in the `src/main/java/com/launchdarkly/hello_android` directory and set the value of LAUNCHDARKLY_MOBILE_KEY to your LaunchDarkly mobile key. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set BOOLEAN_FLAG_KEY to the flag key.

```
.mobileKey("123456abcdef")

private static final String BOOLEAN_FLAG_KEY = "my-boolean-flag";
```

3. Run your application through the Emulator or on a real device.

You should receive the message ”Feature flag ‘<flag key>’ is <true/false> for this user”.
